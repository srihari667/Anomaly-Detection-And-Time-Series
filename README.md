### Question Type Overview

| Q.No | Question | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| 1    | What is Anomaly Detection? Explain its types (point, contextual, collective) with examples. | Theory |
| 2    | Compare Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and Local Outlier Factor in terms of approach and suitable use cases. | Theory |
| 3    | What are the key components of a Time Series? Explain each with one example. | Theory |
| 4    | Define Stationary in time series. How can you test and transform a non-stationary series into a stationary one? | Theory |
| 5    | Differentiate between AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models in terms of structure and application. | Theory |
| 6    | Load a time series dataset (AirPassengers), plot the series, and decompose into trend, seasonality, and residual components. | Practical |
| 7    | Apply Isolation Forest on a numerical dataset (NYC Taxi Fare) to detect anomalies and visualize on a 2D scatter plot. | Practical |
| 8    | Train a SARIMA model on the monthly airline passengers dataset, forecast next 12 months, and visualize. | Practical |
| 9    | Apply Local Outlier Factor (LOF) on a numerical dataset to detect anomalies and visualize using matplotlib. | Practical |
| 10   | Real-time anomaly detection and forecasting workflow for power grid data: explain approach, modeling, validation, and business impact. | Theory + Practical Concept |
